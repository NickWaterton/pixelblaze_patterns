# Example Pattern readme

This pattern demonstrates how to model a simple pattern within this repository.

The pattern itself is the default pattern boilerplate you get with the "New Pattern" button in the Pixelblaze IDE.

The portable form of a Pixelblaze pattern is a file with the `.epe` extension. The .epe format stores the source(s), name, id, and preview image within a JSON object

These components are destructured when stored in this repo so that their component parts may be more easily collaborated with through source control tools.
